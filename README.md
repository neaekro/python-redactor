# python-redactor

## Description
Running server.py will start a Flask server that accepts POST requests containing a file in jpg, jpeg, png formats at localhost:5000. 

It will return a JSON containing "boxes", an array of multiple arrays each of which contains a starting X coordinate, starting Y coordinate, ending X, and ending Y that corresponds to a bounding box around any text the EAST detection model sees. 

The JSON also contains a "text" array that contains strings corresponding to the same index as the box it describes in the "boxes" array.
